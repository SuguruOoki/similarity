# Tree-sitter Integration Analysis

## Executive Summary

After implementing a basic tree-sitter integration prototype and running benchmarks, we've identified significant challenges that need to be addressed before proceeding with a full migration.

## Performance Comparison

### Benchmark Results

| Test Case | oxc_parser | tree-sitter | Performance Ratio |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Small JS  | 1.3µs      | 14.8µs      | 11.4x slower      |
| Medium JS | 10.1µs     | 97.8µs      | 9.7x slower       |
| Large TS  | 12.1µs     | 187.7µs     | 15.5x slower      |

### Analysis

1. **Parsing Overhead**: Tree-sitter is approximately 10-15x slower than oxc_parser
2. **Scaling Issues**: Performance degradation worsens with larger files
3. **Memory Usage**: Not yet measured, but tree-sitter's generic approach may use more memory

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Performance Gap

The current performance gap is too large to ignore:
- **Current performance targets**: Within 50% of oxc_parser
- **Actual results**: 1000-1500% slower
- **Impact on user experience**: Significant slowdown for large codebases

### 2. API Mismatch

The existing codebase is tightly coupled to oxc's AST structure:
- `FunctionDefinition` struct expects `Span` types from oxc
- Tree traversal logic assumes oxc's visitor pattern
- Type extraction relies on oxc's TypeScript-specific AST nodes

### 3. Feature Parity

Tree-sitter's generic approach lacks some TypeScript-specific features:
- No built-in type resolution
- Limited semantic information
- Query-based extraction is less precise than typed AST traversal

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Hybrid Approach
- Keep oxc_parser for TypeScript/JavaScript
- Add tree-sitter for other languages
- Use a common interface for similarity calculation

**Pros**: 
- Maintains current performance for TS/JS
- Enables multi-language support
- Gradual migration path

**Cons**:
- Maintains two parsing systems
- Increased complexity
- Different feature sets per language

### Option 2: Optimize Tree-sitter Integration
- Use tree-sitter's incremental parsing
- Cache parsed trees
- Optimize query patterns
- Use parallel processing

**Pros**:
- Single parsing system
- True multi-language support
- Better error recovery

**Cons**:
- May never match oxc performance
- Significant refactoring required
- Risk of degrading current functionality

### Option 3: Abstract Parser Interface
- Create a generic parser trait
- Implement for both oxc and tree-sitter
- Choose parser based on language/performance needs

```rust
trait CodeParser {
    fn parse(&mut self, source: &str) -> Result<TreeNode, Error>;
    fn extract_functions(&mut self, source: &str) -> Result<Vec<FunctionDef>, Error>;
    fn extract_types(&mut self, source: &str) -> Result<Vec<TypeDef>, Error>;
}
```

**Pros**:
- Maximum flexibility
- Clean architecture
- Future-proof design

**Cons**:
- Additional abstraction layer
- More initial work
- Potential performance overhead

## Recommendations

1. **Short Term**: Implement Option 3 (Abstract Parser Interface)
   - Preserves current performance
   - Allows incremental migration
   - Enables A/B testing of parsers

2. **Medium Term**: Add tree-sitter for non-JS/TS languages
   - Python, Rust, Go, etc.
   - Accept performance trade-off for multi-language support

3. **Long Term**: Continue optimizing tree-sitter
   - Investigate caching strategies
   - Profile and optimize hot paths
   - Consider contributing optimizations upstream

## Next Steps

1. Design and implement parser abstraction interface
2. Refactor existing code to use abstraction
3. Add tree-sitter implementation behind interface
4. Benchmark abstraction overhead
5. Add support for Python as proof of concept
6. Gather user feedback on performance vs. features trade-off

## Conclusion

While tree-sitter offers compelling multi-language support, the current performance gap is too significant for a direct replacement. A hybrid approach that preserves oxc_parser's performance for JavaScript/TypeScript while enabling tree-sitter for other languages appears to be the most pragmatic path forward.
