## Performance Overview

The Rust implementation provides significant performance improvements over the original TypeScript prototype:
- TypeScript/JavaScript parsing: Uses oxc-parser for ~10x faster parsing
- Parallel processing: Leverages Rayon for concurrent file processing
- Memory efficiency: Optimized AST representations and algorithms
